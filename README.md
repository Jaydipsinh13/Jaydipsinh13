👋 Hi, I'm **Jaydipsinh Solanki**, a recent graduate and a **jugadu** at heart—always finding creative solutions to problems.

I currently work at an ed-tech startup, contributing to the [**Edutor App**](http://edutorapp.com) 📱, an open-source platform connecting teachers and students (300K+ downloads for the mobile app and 100K+ users for the web app). My role involves understanding requirements and building product features using both frontend and backend development 🛠️. I started out working on frontend development, but now I’m focused on backend development, where my role involves understanding requirements and building product features.

You can reach out to me at **jaydipsinhsolanki9297@gmail.com** and I'll get back to you within 24 hours! 📧
