Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jaydipsinh Solanki, a final-year BCA student at Gokul Global University, Sidhapur, Gujarat. I'm passionate about full-stack development and love working with various programming languages and tech tools and have been working as a full-stack developer at an ed-tech startup for the past year.

I'm involved with [Edutor App](http://edutorapp.com), an open-source platform where teachers create content and students access it via a mobile app (250K+ downloads) or a web app (100K+ users). My role includes understanding requirements, building roadmaps, designing system architecture, and developing the backend with Node.js. I also work with React.js for the frontend. Additionally, I'm learning about cloud services on AWS to build end-to-end products.
